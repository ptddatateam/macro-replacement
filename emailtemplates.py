<p>Most communication from WSDOT regarding the <em>Summary of Public Transportation</em> will come from myself via KennaMa@wsdot.wa.gov. I ask that you respond to this email directly, as it helps us track communication between you and WSDOT. </p>
<p>If you are no longer responsible for this reporting, please contact us as soon as possible with contact information for the appropriate person.</p>
<p>For reference, you can view last year&rsquo;s report, <em>2017 Summary of Public Transportation</em>, <a href="https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/manuals/fulltext/M3079/spt.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your assistance in the production of the <em>Summary of Public Transportation </em>for the 2018 calendar year.</p>
