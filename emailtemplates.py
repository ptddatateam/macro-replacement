pastdueptsummary ="<HTML><BODY> On June 1, 2018, we sent a coversheet request to your agency regarding submitting financial and service data to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). <br />" \
    "<br />"\
    "<b>The requested coversheet is due now. Please find your agency’s coversheet attached, review it, make any corrections on the second page, and submit it as soon as possible.</b><br />"\
    "<br />"\
    "WSDOT will use this coversheet to produce this year’s Summary of Public Transportation, which reports data for the 2017 calendar year. Your data is required for the Summary of Public Transportation per <a href = 'https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35.58.2796'> RCW 35.58.2796</a>. <br />"\

    "During the preparation of the report, one of the WSDOT reports team members (see below) may contact you: <br />"\

    "<br />" \
    "Most communication from WSDOT regarding the Summary of Public Transportation will come via PTSummary@wsdot.wa.gov. We ask that you respond to this email directly, as it helps us track communication between you and WSDOT. Note that the email address is different than the one your organization used last year. Please add this email address to your list of accepted email addresses. <br />"\

    "If you are no longer responsible for this reporting, please contact us as soon as possible with contact information for the appropriate person. <br />"\

"The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires WSDOT to submit an annual National Transit Database (NTD) report on your behalf. We are beginning the 2018 NTD reporting effort. Attached are your reporting forms for the 2018 report year.  Note that any information you report is for the January 1 – December 31, 2018 calendar year. <br />"\
"<br />" \
"The worksheets included in this email are as follows: RR-20, A-30 Revenue Vehicle Inventory, A-15 Facilities, A-35 Equipment,  A-90 Transit Asset Management and Performance Targets, and a set of instructions. Please note that the FTA expanded its asset inventory reporting requirements this year, which is why there are many more inventory forms to fill out. Please see the attached set of instructions for a more detailed overview of each form. <br />"\
"<br />" \
'One other thing to stress: if you could please include your agency fleet ids in each datasheet, as WSDOT is working on simplifying the reporting process, and having accurate matches between agency vehicles and NTD IDs is critical for our ability to do that work.<br />'\

"For more detailed instructions on how to fill out any of the forms, please refer to <a href = 'https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/2018-ntd-reduced-reporting-manual'> the 2018 Policy Manual </a>. Note that you are referred to as a “sub-recipient,” as NTD considers WSDOT to be the “recipient.”<br />"\

"If you have any questions during this process, email ntd@wsdot.wa.gov,  call Nathan Schumer at 206-716-1121, or call Matthew Kenna at 206-716-1104. In order to meet the reporting deadline, your completed form is needed by close of business on Friday March 22, 2019. Lastly, please immediately reply to this e-mail to acknowledge receipt so that I know it has been received and sent to the correct individual. <br />"\
